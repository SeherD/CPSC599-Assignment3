A report (maximum two pages) highlighting different approaches to improving your model and avoiding overfitting.
- stretch to 214 x 214
- count the number of training samples
- rotate, flip, blur, or manipulate the color balance of the image in a way that the label remains valid to increase the number of samples for classes that don't have as much
- number of classes
- We train a model for the secondary task, remove the final layers, and replace them with new layers appropriate to the primary task. 
- we will try to use the https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/generated/torchvision.datasets.StanfordCars.html#torchvision.datasets.StanfordCars cars dataset from pytorch to train the earlier layers that will identify features in images of like shapes and lines and edges and car features?
- we can freeze the earlier layers and then exchange the later layers for new empty layers
- We then train only the new layers or fine-tune the entire network for the primary task.
